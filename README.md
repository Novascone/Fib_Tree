## Create a webpage using as little HTML as possible

In order to give you better real-world experience with git, you will begin by
taking up an incomplete project. Your first priority is to study this code to
understand how it is organized, to learn what features are already provided,
and find where to add the new code to satisfy the requirements set forth on
Canvas. It is up to you to _read the code_ and understand what all of it is
doing.

## Cloning this repository on your computer

1.  Open your Anaconda Prompt
2.  Make sure that you're not already inside of a git repository
    -   $ git status
        fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
        Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
3.  Clone this repository from Bitbucket
4.  Create a blank  _private_ repository of your own in Bitbucket. Do not
    create a README.md file from the web page.
5.  Leaving my repository's URL as the _origin_, add your own repository as
    another remote repository.  You will pull my code from _origin_, and push
    your own work to your own remote repository.

In a nutshell:

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/erikfalor/cs2610-falor-erik-assn4 cs2610-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn4
    $ cd cs2610-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn4
    $ git remote add myrepo git@bitbucket.org:YOUR_USERNAME/cs2610-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn4
    $ git push -u myrepo master
